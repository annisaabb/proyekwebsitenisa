		I have liked to sing and dance since I was a child,that's one of the reasons why I wanted to become a musician. My university friends and i have been performing and participating in music competition. And of course, we've been winning in every competition that we're in. I didn't mean to be a snob but that's the fact and don't get me wrong,i'm not even in  any major that's related to music or dancing. Infact, i'm a student that studies in the business department. Yes, A business major. I mean, I'm just following what my dad's wants. I'm not complaining though, he still allowed me to play music and even supported me. Being a musician is my dream,but i don't think that i could make it. and why is that? simple,because i  still have the responsibility to continue my dad's company.I'm not going to throw a fit because i know what my responsibilities are. So,instead of being the musician i wanted to be, i think it would be better if i change my career to become a business man. Sounds cool right? oh and btw,even though i'm still studying in college, once in a while my dad asks me to handle his portion of works and take care of the company while i'm in my free time. Exhausting as it is,but it's going to be my job in the future.
